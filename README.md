# Travel Ghana 
This is a travel website for travellers planning on visiting Ghana or for people living in Ghana who need advise on where to explore in the country. The aim of the website is to provide the user an overview of Ghana both in history and in top attractions. An penalised itinerary is also offered to those who may be interested.

The Travel Ghana website consists of a homepage which briefly introduces users to the rich history of Ghana, an attractions page which includes a range of places to visit when in Ghana. Finally a contact page for user to get in contact if they need further assistance or would like a personalised itinerary created for their time in Ghana.

## User Experience (UX)
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
